# TOOL1_FINAL_PROJECT

## General info
This project is an analysis of drug poisoning mortalities in the United States from 2011-2018. The analysis will explore death rates by state, sex, and race to determine if there are any significant correlations or trends based on these parameters. The dataset was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS): https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-drug-poisoning-mortality-by-state-united-states

## Reports
In this repo you will find a Jupyter notebook and a pdf report. The Jupyter notebook contains all of the code blocks and their output for data cleaning, analysis, as well as some commentary on the analysis results. The pdf report contains a more formal write up on the topic of interest and how the analysis sheds light on drug overdoses in the United States today.
